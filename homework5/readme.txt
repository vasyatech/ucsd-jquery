Your job is to build a 3 step form using jquery. You will use the attached wireframe and replicate the 3 step form with animation between each step. Follow the instructions and good luck. As always, kdsecor@gmail.com is only an email away

Don't use codepen - use real files .html, .css and .js

Use jQuery - <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js" integrity="sha256-cCueBR6CsyA4/9szpPfrX3s49M9vUU5BgtiJj06wt/s=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

Use HTML and CSS to give the form a nice design, the wireframes only denote content and functionality. 
You may change the style and layout of any of the elements as long as the content and functionality remain intact.

When the form moves forward (next) or backward (previous) it should animate in some way


Validate that the email has an @ symbol and a proper domain (like gmail.com, or ucsd.edu)

Validate that both passwords match

Validate the phone number in ###-###-#### format

Validate that the terms of service checkbox is checked

Show an error message if any of the validations fail.

Don’t allow the form to move forward until validations are met.

On the final thank you page, all of the form information should be displayed to the user (except the password)

The progress bar denoted in the diagrams should update and tell the user what step they're currently on.
